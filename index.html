        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>Portfolio Website for<a href="https://mehulsen.in/ target="_blank"> Mehul Sen (Video Editor)</a></h3>
        <p class="date">Role: Project Manager & Technical Lead</p>
        <p>I led the development of a personal portfolio website for Mehul Sen,
            a professional video editor, where I managed a two-member team from start to finish.
            As the project manager and technical lead, I was responsible for overseeing the development process, 
            ensuring smooth collaboration, and delivering the project on time. 
            My role extended beyond team coordination to handling all technical aspects of the deployment,
            including DNS configurations, domain and hosting setup, and integrating Cloudflare for enhanced security and performance.
            This project allowed me to combine leadership with hands-on technical work, resulting in a well-optimized, client-ready website that effectively showcases Mehul’s creative portfolio.</p>


        <h3>Minecraft–Discord Voice Verification System (Java, Python, MongoDB)</h3></h3>
        <p>For Mr. Random’s Minecraft SMP, I developed a real-time voice verification system that connected the Minecraft Java server with his Discord community using MongoDB. 
        The system allowed users to register for the SMP, during which a document was created in a MongoDB database containing their in-game name (ign), Discord ID (discord_id), and a voice_state boolean.
        A custom Discord bot written in Python monitored users' voice channel activity and updated the voice_state to true whenever a user joined a VC, and to false when they left.
        On the server side, I created a custom Minecraft plugin in Java that regularly queried the database every second. Before allowing a player to join, the plugin checked whether their voice_state was set to true.
        If not, they were prevented from joining. Additionally, if a player left the Discord VC while already in-game, the plugin would automatically detect the change and kick them from the server in real time. 
        This integration ensured that only those actively participating in the voice chat were allowed to play, encouraging better communication and collaboration among players. 
        The project showcased seamless cross-platform synchronization between Minecraft, Discord, and MongoDB.</p>

        <h3>Custom Model Renderer for Minecraft (Java)</h3>
        <p>Developed a custom model rendering system for Minecraft modding in Java. 
        This tool automates the creation of new entity models by generating separate renderer classes, making it easier to integrate custom 3D models into the game.
        It streamlines the process of defining model structure, animations, and textures, ensuring modular, organized, and scalable code-ideal for large modding projects or complex entity designs.</p>

        <h3>Random-GPT: Advanced Discord Bot for Mr. Random</h3>
        <p>Developed an all-in-one custom Discord bot for Mr. Random’s server, packed with unique and interactive features designed to enhance community engagement.</p>
        <h5>🔸 Mrify Command</h5>
        <p>A signature feature that generates a personalized Mr. Random-themed logo for users in any color. 
        The bot auto-detects user gender from their roles and applies distinct text styles. 
        It integrates with a MongoDB database to manage a credit system—users receive 3 credits on joining the server and earn more by leveling up. 
        Each logo generation costs 1 credit, encouraging interaction and progression.</p>

        <h5>🔸 Live IPL Scoreboard</h5>
        <p>Using the /scoreboard command, users can fetch real-time, detailed IPL cricket match data, presented in a clean and readable format-perfect for cricket fans in the community.
        It allows users to check live scores directly within Discord without needing to open a browser or switch apps, making it super convenient while they’re chatting. 
        This seamless integration not only improves accessibility but also boosts server engagement by keeping users active and informed in real time.</p>
        <img src="./images/scoreboard.png" alt="scorecard" class="small-rectangle-image">

        <h5>🔸 Smart Voice Channel Join System</h5>
        <p>When a VC is full, users can tag someone inside it to request a drag.
            The mentioned user receives interactive buttons to approve or deny the request with a single click—adding a smooth, non-intrusive way to manage VC entries.</p>
        <img src="./images/drag.jpg" alt="scorecard" class="small-rectangle-image">
        <br>
        <p>Random-GPT showcases creative automation, user personalization, and real-time interactivity, all in one powerful bot tailored for Mr. Random’s community.</p>
        
        <h3>Among Us Random Map Generator</h3>
        <p>During the peak of Among Us popularity, I created a fun side project - a Random Among Us Map Generator.
            It lets users generate unique, randomized layouts inspired by the game's classic maps, adding a twist of unpredictability to each session. 
            Built purely for fun and creativity, it showcases my ability to blend trends with interactive tools while experimenting with design and logic.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/MrRandomUniverse/IPL-Event-2025/blob/main/README.md target="_blank">IPL XP Betting System for Mr. Random</a></h3>
        <p>I initially developed the IPL-based XP betting system used in Mr. Random’s community during the early phases of the 2025 IPL Event.
            The system allowed users to place XP-based bets on IPL matches directly within Discord, making the experience highly interactive and engaging.</p>
        <p>It featured key mechanics like XP deduction, match locking and result processing, and leaderboard updates. 
            Later, the system was migrated to Skybot (developed by Lakshay Krishna) for improved scalability and additional features-but it still retained core components and critical logic originally written by me. 
            This project reflects my ability to design scalable, gamified systems tightly integrated with real-time events and community engagement.</p>

        <h3>Crisis Update & Misinformation Monitoring System (India–Pakistan War Tensions 2025)</h3>
        <p>During the heightened tensions of the India–Pakistan conflict in 2025, I developed a real-time crisis update system for Discord that delivered verified, timely information to keep communities informed and safe.</p>
        <p>The system fetched updates from multiple trusted sources and posted blackout alerts, drone strike reports, government press conference summaries, live war guidelines, safety protocols and emergency contact numbers from affected or areas at risk.</p>
        <p>All data passed through 2–3 automated filters and 1 manual verification layer to prevent the spread of misinformation. The goal was to provide fast, reliable, and clear communication during a national emergency and help those in need.</p>
        <p>Alongside this, I also developed a fake news & viral video monitoring integration. This system identified and flagged viral misinformation on social media, sharing credible source links, original context, and fact-check summaries-helping users distinguish real from fake.
            These tools showcased a powerful mix of automation, ethical responsibility, and real-time communication, ensuring digital communities remained both informed and protected during critical moments.</p>

        <h3>Team Chat Plugin for Minecraft (Java - Spigot)</h3>
        <p>Created a custom Minecraft Java plugin for Mr. Random’s special event featuring three themed teams: Desert, Snow, and Forest. 
        The plugin introduced a toggable team chat system, allowing players to seamlessly switch between team-only communication and global chat during gameplay. 
        Designed for performance and simplicity, the system helped improve coordination while keeping the event immersive and organized. 
        Built using the Spigot API.</p>

    <h2>My attempt of creating devlogs, January 2023</h2>
    <p>Back in January 2023, I started this exciting journey to document my game development process through devlogs. This video is the first 55 seconds I edited as part of that attempt. The game was progressing well, but unfortunately, I never completed the full video.
Shortly after, I got deeply involved in my JEE preparation and had to put the project and devlogs on hold.
Now, after a long break, I’m slowly getting back into learning game development again bit by bit, day by day. This video stands as a reminder of where I left off, and the journey I’m preparing to restart.
Thanks for watching 💙
